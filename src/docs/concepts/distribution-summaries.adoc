A distribution summary is used to track the distribution of events. It is similar to a timer structurally, but records values that do not represent a unit of time. For example, a distribution summary could be used to measure the payload sizes of requests hitting a server.

To create a distribution summary:

[source, java]
----
DistributionSummary summary = registry.summary("response.size");
----

The interface contains a fluent builder for distribution summaries:

[source, java]
----
DistributionSummary summary = DistributionSummary
    .builder("response.size")
    .description("a description of what this summary does") // optional
    .baseUnit("bytes") // optional <1>
    .tags("region", "test") // optional
    .scale(100) // optional <2>
    .register(registry);
----

1. Add base units for maximum portability -- base units are part of the naming convention for some monitoring systems. Leaving it off and violating the naming convention will have no adverse effect if you forget.
2. Optionally, you may provide a scaling factor that each recorded sample will be multipled by as it is recorded.
