Counters report a single metric, a count. The `Counter` interface allows you to increment by a fixed amount, which may be negative.

When building graphs and alerts off of counters, generally you should be most interested in measuring the rate at which some event is occurring over a given time interval. Consider a simple queue. Counters could be used to measure things like the rate at which items are being inserted and removed.

It's tempting at first to conceive of visualizing absolute counts rather than a rate, but the absolute count is usually both a function of the rapidity with which something is used *and* the longevity of the application instance under instrumentation. Building dashboards and alerts of the rate of a counter per some interval of time disregards the longevity of the app, letting you see aberrant behaivor long after the app has started.

Be sure to read through the timer section before jumping in to using counters, as timers record a count of the timed events as a separate metric. For those pieces of code you intend to time, you do NOT need to add a counter separately.

The following code simulates a real counter whose rate exhibits some perturbation over a short time window.

RandomEngine r = new MersenneTwister64(0);
Normal dist = new Normal(0, 1, r);

MeterRegistry registry = ...
Counter counter = registry.counter("counter");

Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(10))
        .doOnEach(d -> {
            if (dist.nextDouble() + 0.1 > 0) { <1>
                counter.increment();
            }
        })
        .blockLast();

ifeval::["{system}" == "atlas"]
Atlas serves up graphs in the form of PNG images (and in other https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/wiki/Output-Formats[output formats] as well).

We use the following query to visualize the counter from Atlas with an explanation of some of the query parameters we are setting to control the rendering of the graph. Note that the value is rate-normalized over the step interval rather than monotonically increasing.

<1> The range of time we want to visualize along the x-axis. `e` represents the end time or "now". This graph's axis will be from 15 minutes ago until now. Atlas automatically chooses the finest grained step interval available from the data that would render at least 1px wide on the resultant image.

<3> Set the y-axis lower limit to be 0 so random perturbation in the walk doesn't look so dramatic.

ifeval::["{system}" == "datadog"]
Datadog rate-normalizes counters over a time window. The query that generates a graph for the random-walk counter is `counter`.

`rate(counter[10s])`.

Representing a counter without rate normalization over some time window is rarely useful, as the representation is a function of both the rapidity with which the counter is incremented and the longevity of the service. The following image shows how the counter drops back to zero on service restart. The rate-normalized graph above would return back to a value around 55 as soon as the new instance (say on a production deployment) was in service.

The registry contains a fluent builder for counters:

[source, java]

Counter counter = Counter
    .builder("counter")
    .description("a description of what this counter does") // optional
    .tags("region", "test") // optional
    .register(registry);

== Function-tracking counters

Micrometer also provides a more infrequently used counter pattern that tracks a monotonically increasing function (a function that stays the same or increases over time, but never decreases). Some monitoring systems, like Prometheus, push cumulative values for counters to the backend, but others publish the rate at which a counter is incrementing over the push interval. By employing this pattern, you allow the Micrometer implementation for your monitoring system to choose whether to rate normalize the counter or not and your counter remains portable across different types of monitoring systems.

[source, java]
-----
Cache c = ...; // suppose we have a Guava cache with stats recording on
registry.more().counter("evictions", tags, cache, c -> c.stats().evictionCount()); <1>
-----

1. `evictionCount()` is a monotonically increasing function incrementing with every cache eviction from the beginning of its life.

The function-tracking counter, in concert with the monitoring system's rate normalizing functionality (whether this is an artifact of the query language or the way data is pushed to the system), adds a layer of richness on top of the cumulative value of the function itself. You can reason about the _rate_ at which the value is increasing, whether that rate is within an acceptable bound, is increasing or decreasing over time, etc.

WARNING: Micrometer cannot guarantee the monotonicity of the function for you. By using this signature, you are asserting its monotonicity based on what you know about its definition.
