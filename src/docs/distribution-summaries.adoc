A distribution summary is used to track the distribution of events. It is similar to a timer but more general in that the size does not have to be a period of time. For example, a distribution summary could be used to measure the payload sizes of requests hitting a server.

To create a distribution summary:

[source, java]
----
DistributionSummary summary = registry.summary("response.size");
----

The registry contains a fluent builder for distribution summaries:

[source, java]
----
DistributionSummary summary = DistributionSummary
    .builder("response.size")
    .description("a description of what this summary does") // optional
    .baseUnit("bytes") // optional <1>
    .tags("region", "test") // optional
    .register(registry);
----

1. Add base units for maximum portability -- base units are part of the naming convention for some monitoring systems. Leaving it off and violating the naming convention will have no adverse effect if you forget.
