`Executor` and `ExecutorService` instances can be instrumented with the registry. This includes any specializations of these types created by `java.util.concurrent.Executors`. Additionally, you can directly monitor `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` and `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler` in a similar way, but they must be initialized prior to attempting to instrument them.

```java
@Configuration
class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean("worker_pool")
    ExecutorService workerPool(MeterRegistry registry) {
        return Meters.monitor(registry,
            Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8),
            "worker_pool",
            "threads", "8" // any number of tag key value pairs
        );
    }
}
```

`ExecutorService` instrumentation results in a composite counter that tracks the number of submitted, active, and completed tasks. Additionally, a timer records the execution time of tasks (plus a count of such tasks, since `Timer` objectss always track both count and totalTime statistics).

`Executor` instrumentation just records the execution time.
