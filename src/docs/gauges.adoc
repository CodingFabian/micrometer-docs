A gauge is a handle to get the current value. Typical examples for gauges would be the size of a collection or map or number of threads in a running state.

TIP: Gauges are useful for monitoring things with natural upper bounds. We don't recommend using a gauge to monitor things like request count, as they can grow without bound for the duration of an application instance's life.

Micrometer takes the stance that gauges should be sampled and not set, so there is no information about what might have occurred between samples. After all, any intermediate values set on a gauge are lost by the time the gauge value is reported to a metrics backend anyway, so there seems to be little value in setting those intermediate values in the first place.

If it helps, think of a `Gauge` as a "heisenberg gauge" - a meter that only changes when it is observed.

The `MeterRegistry` interface contains a number of convenience methods for instrumenting collections, maps, executors, and caches with gauges.

----
AtomicInteger n = registry.gauge("numberGauge", new AtomicInteger(0)); <1>
List<String> list = registry.gauge("listGauge", Collections.emptyList(), new ArrayList<>(), List::size); <2>
List<String> list = registry.collectionSize(new ArrayList<>(), "listGauge2"); <3>
Map<String, Integer> map = registry.mapSize(new HashMap<>(), "mapGauge");

<1> The simplest form of gauge monitors any `Number` instance. Note that unlike other meter types you don't get a reference to the `Gauge` when creating one, but rather the thing being observed. This is because of the heisenguage principal; the gauge is self sufficient once created, so you should never need to interact with it. This allows us to give you back only the instrumented object, which allows for quick one liners that both create the object to be observed and set up metrics around it.
<2> A slightly more common form of gauge is one that monitors some non-numeric object. The last argument establishes the function that is used to determine the value of the gauge when the gauge is observed.
<3> A more convenient form of (2) for when you simply want to monitor collection size.

All of the different forms of creating a gauge maintain only a weak reference to the object being observed, so as not to prevent garbage collection of the object.

ifeval::["{system}" == "prometheus"]
NOTE: In Prometheus, a gauge is a generalization of a counter that also happens to allow for decrementing. If you view a gauge as something that is actively set by the application application code rather than sampled, it is clear that your code would have to increment and decrement the gauge as the size of the thing being measured changes. Diligent incrementing and decrementing throughout the application code yields the same result as the "Heisenberg gauge," ultimately.
