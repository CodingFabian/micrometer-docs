Graphite is one of the most popular current hierarchical metrics systems backed by a fixed-size database, similar in design and purpose to RRD. It originated at Orbitz in 2006 and was open sourced in 2008.

== Configuring

[source,java]
----
GraphiteConfig graphiteConfig = new GraphiteConfig() {
    @Override
    public String host() {
        return "mygraphitehost";
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String k) {
        return null; // accept the rest of the defaults
    }
};

MeterRegistry registry = new GraphiteMeterRegistry(graphiteConfig, HierarchicalNameMapper.DEFAULT, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

Micrometer uses Dropwizard Metrics as the underlying instrumentation library when recording metrics destined for Graphite. `GraphiteConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you  instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring support binds properties prefixed with `management.metrics.export.graphite` directly to the `GraphiteConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.graphite:
    # The location of your Graphite server
    host: mygraphitehost

    # You will probably want to conditionally disable Graphite publishing in local development.
    enabled: true

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to Graphite. See Duration.parse for the expected format.
    # The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m

== Graphing

This section serves as a quickstart to rendering useful representations in Graphite for metrics originating in Micrometer.

=== Counters

Graphite counters measure mean throughput and one-, five-, and fifteen-minute exponentially-weighted moving average throughputs.
