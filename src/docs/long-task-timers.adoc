The long task timer is a special type of timer that lets you measure time while an event being measured is *still running*. A timer does not record the duration until the task is complete.

Now consider a background process to refresh metadata from a data store. For example, Edda caches AWS resources such as instances, volumes, auto-scaling groups, and others . Normally all data can be refreshed in a few minutes. If the AWS services have problems, it can take much longer. A long duration timer can be used to track the overall time for refreshing the metadata.

For example, in a Spring application, it is common for such long running processes to be implemented with `@Scheduled`. Micrometer provides a special `@Timed` annotation for instrumenting these processes with a long task timer.

[source, java]
----
@Timed(value = "aws.scrape", longTask = true)
@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 360000)
void scrapeResources() {
    // find instances, volumes, auto-scaling groups, etc...
}
----

It is up to the application framework to make something happen with `@Timed`. If your framework of choice does not support it, you can still use the long task timer:

[source, java]
----
LongTaskTimer scrapeTimer = registry.more().longTaskTimer("scrape");
void scrapeResources() {
    scrapeTimer.record(() => {
        // find instances, volumes, auto-scaling groups, etc...
    });
}
----

If we wanted to alert when this process exceeds `threshold`, with a long task timer we will receive that alert at the first reporting interval after we have exceeded the threshold. With a regular timer, we wouldn't receive the alert until the first reporting interval after the process completed, over an hour later!

The Prometheus query to plot the long task timer is `longTaskTimer{statistic="duration"}`. In Grafana, we can set an alert threshold at some fixed point.

The Influx query to plot the long task timer is:

`SELECT sum("duration") FROM "longTaskTimer" WHERE $timeFilter GROUP BY time(10s) fill(null)`

In Grafana, we can set an alert threshold at some fixed point.

The registry contains a fluent builder for long task timers:

[source, java]
----
LongTaskTimer longTaskTimer = registry
    .longTaskTimerBuilder("timer")
    .description("a description of what this timer does") // optional
    .tags("region", "test") // optional
    .create();
