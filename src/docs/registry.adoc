A `Meter` is the interface for collecting a set of measurements (which we individually call metrics) about your application. Meters in Micrometer are created from and held in a `MeterRegistry`. Each supported monitoring system has an implementation of `MeterRegistry`. Micrometer includes a set of `Meter` primitives, including: `Timer`, `Counter`, `Gauge`, `DistributionSummary`, and `LongTaskTimer`. Note that different meter types result in a different number of metrics. For example, while there is a single metric that represents a `Gauge`, a `Timer` measures both number of timed events and the total time of all events being timed. Exporters use the meter registry to iterate over the set of meters instrumenting your application and then further iterate over each meter's metrics, generally resulting in a time series in the metrics backend for each combination of metrics and their dimension values.

To create the registry:

ifeval::["{system}" == "atlas"]
[source,java]
----
AtlasRegistry spectatorAtlas = new AtlasRegistry(Clock.SYSTEM, new AtlasConfig() {
    @Override
    public Duration step() {
        return Duration.ofSeconds(10);
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String k) {
        return null; // accept the rest of the defaults
    }
});
spectatorAtlas.start();
MeterRegistry registry = new SpectatorMeterRegistry(spectatorAtlas);
----

Micrometer uses Netflix's https://github.com/netflix/spectator[Spectator] as the underlying instrumentation library when recording metrics destined for Atlas. `AtlasConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you  instead bind it to a property source, you can override default configuration through properties prefixed with `atlas`. For example, if properties were loaded from a yml configuration:

[source,yml]
----
# The location of your Atlas server
atlas.uri: http://localhost:7101/api/v1/publish

# You will probably want to conditionally disable Atlas publishing in local development.
atlas.enabled: true

# The interval at which metrics are sent to Atlas. See Duration.parse for the expected format.
# The default is 1 minute.
atlas.step: PT1M
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{system}" == "datadog"]
== Spectator-backed registry that pushes directly to datadoghq

Metrics are rate-normalized and pushed to datadoghq on a periodic interval. Rate normalization performed by the Spectator-backed registry yields datasets that are quite similar to those produced by dogstatsd.

.Two metrics with the same input data, one aggregated by dogstatsd and the other by the Spectator-backed registry.

DatadogConfig config = new DatadogConfig() {
    @Override
    public Duration step() {
        return Duration.ofSeconds(10);
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String k) {
        return null; // accept the rest of the defaults
    }
};
MeterRegistry registry = new DatadogMeterRegistry(Clock.SYSTEM, config);

`DatadogConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you instead bind it to a property source, you can override default configuration through properties prefixed with `datadog`. For example, if properties were loaded from a yml configuration:

[source, yaml]
----
datadog.apiKey: YOURKEY

# You will probably want disable Atlas publishing in a local development profile.
datadog.enabled: true

# The interval at which metrics are sent to Datadog. See Duration.parse for the expected format.
# The default is 10 seconds, which matches the Datadog Agent publishes at.
