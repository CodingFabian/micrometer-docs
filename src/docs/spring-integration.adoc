Metrics for Spring integration are collected automatically if Spring integration is on the classpath.

Three gauges are monitored:

1. `spring.integration.channelNames` - Number of channel names
2. `spring.integration.handlerNames` - Number of handler names
3. `spring.integration.sourceNames` - Number of source names

For each source, a counter (`spring.integration.source.messages`) is registered.
